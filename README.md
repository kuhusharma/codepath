## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
### Some favorite applications of mine: 
#### 1. Messenger 
- Customizable chat screen for each person (nickname, background color, message color, etc)
- Unsending messages 
- Pinning messages 
- Sending voice memos! 

#### 2. Tiktok 
- Rapid content generation and ingestion 
- Infinite scroll (a controversial feature that i may love and hate at the same time)
- Easy integration with messaging apps: easy to send videos to people cross-platform

#### 3. BeReal.  
- Ability to upload new type of content: front & back camera pictures at the same time 
- Daily refresh of content
- Customizable content: only see friends' bereals
- Easy integration with messaging apps: easy to port bereal memories to other apps 

### Potential app idea: 
Social media apps have been largely the same for a couple of decades now, in that users are able to 1) connect with their community and 2) easily access new communities as well. In the past few years, apps like BeReal and Tiktok have isolated these two major uses for social media and created apps around one singular function. This type of app ideation is fascinating to me because it breaks from tradition, stemming from MySpace and Facebook. To me, what is notable is that the role of content creation/ingestion is vastly increased in these app ideas, to the point that commentary on content is a side effect, not a primary intent. 

    With that in mind, an app I'd like to build is an improvement upon this. BeReal is nice in that it only serves to filter content from the community you choose, but it prevents you from getting in contact with new people (adding someone on BeReal prompts the notification "do you *really* know this person?"). I'd like to create an app that has the features of a daily refresh of content and a barrier to commentary — you can't see the content until you make some yourself — with a major difference in that you are joining communities in which everybody has a common interest. For example, if you enjoy content about a period of history, you can join a community in which you donate a fact about history in order to see other facts. This would require effort to scale the idea, as there are some communities in which updates are not nearly as frequent, which is something I hope to welcome feedback on. 


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I'm new to Xcode (hence attempting to do this), and as such ran into some errors with setting up Xcode assistant and creating interactions. Attempting to create an action and linking it to the 'ViewController' Swift file led me to accidentally link it to the 'AppDelegate' Swift file, which was an amusing Google search in order to fix.
